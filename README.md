# R Packages Trends 

## Understanding trends and comparing popularity of R packages


__rtrends__ package has several functions, but the most important one (in my opinion) is **cran_stats_by_packages** which alows you to get CRAN downloads information for a range of dates and for a list of packages.
This functionality is quite similar to the one offered by Google trends.

One of the advantages of rtrends is that it allows you to understand how certain technologies are being implemented among R users (in contrast to Google trends, where you are not always sure if a specific search relates to a specific technology or to some other unrelated issue).
